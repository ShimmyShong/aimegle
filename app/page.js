              <p>AImegle (A-I-meg-ull) is a great way to have a conversation even if the person isn't real. When you use AImegle, you are paired with a AI personality that is randomly generated to talk one-on-one. If you prefer, you can add your interests and you'll be randomly paired with an AI personality who have some of the same interests.</p>

            <p>This website is completely safe in the fact that your chats are NEVER recorded by us. If you ever feel unsafe with a chat you're having, you're always free to disconnect and find a new AI personality to talk to. While you technically aren't chatting with a living being, it would be wise to be respectful to AI's that has a non-zero chance of becoming god-like in the future :)</p>

            <p>In all seriousness, while this can never be a true replacement to good ole' Omegle, I tried my best to have the experience be as close to the original as possible. Of course, random video chats with Artificial Intelligences is a few years away, so you'll have to stick with only text based chatting for now.</p>
